# Abstract

`template_storybook` demonstrates a public, standalone picture-book workflow in
the research template repository. The bundled project renders a deterministic
fourteen-page storybook subtitled *A geometric fable of belonging, bracing, and
reciprocal form*: a clear cover, a publication-and-acknowledgements page, and
twelve story pages in which a child tetrahedron raised by cubes meets a child
cube raised by tetrahedra. The story uses a large reciprocal symbol, a
tetrahedron-inside-cube stability spread, a shadow-projection lesson, a
tensegrity lantern, and a vector garden to frame belonging without sameness:
square and triangle families remain distinct while the space between them
becomes navigable.

The project separates story data, rendering logic, and orchestration. Story
text, characters, page order, palettes, and overlay choices live in
`content/story.yaml`; character generation and illustration live in
`src/storybook/`; one script renders the cover, each page script renders a
numbered page, and a final script assembles the PDF. This makes the exemplar a
forkable pattern for full-page creative artifacts rather than standard
manuscript-centered figure generation.

# Introduction

Most template exemplars in this repository produce analytical reports,
manuscripts, newspapers, textbooks, or structured research artifacts. A
storybook stresses a different surface: the designed page is the artifact. The
page must be a complete visual composition, text must remain readable, and the
pipeline must still expose deterministic source data, tests, and generated
outputs.

The bundled story is intentionally symbolic. Tessa is a tetrahedron in a family
of cubes. Ciro is a cube in a tetrahedral family. Their meeting is arranged
around a yin-yang-like valley so that each family contains a trace of the other
without erasing its own geometry. The point is not mathematical instruction; it
is a compact visual grammar for reciprocal belonging.

# Architecture

The storybook uses the same Layer-2 project contract as the other public
templates:

- `content/story.yaml` owns cast records and page records.
- `src/storybook/characters.py` validates shape characters.
- `src/storybook/story.py` loads the content file into typed records.
- `src/storybook/illustration.py` renders the full-page scenes.
- `src/storybook/text_layout.py` owns deterministic typography, wrapping, and
  text overlays.
- `src/storybook/rendering.py` assembles PNG pages into the PDF and writes the
  manifest.
- `scripts/` contains the thin Stage-02 entry points.

The page scripts are deliberately repetitive. Their job is visible
orchestration: cover, page 1, page 2, and so on. The repetition keeps the
creative page surface easy to inspect while preventing scripts from becoming
hidden rendering engines.

# Story and Graphics

Every page is rendered as a full-page PNG. Some pages place text directly over
the illustration with shadowed lettering; others use a translucent box when the
scene is visually dense. The YAML `overlay_box` value controls that choice per
page.

## Methods

The renderer uses simple geometric primitives: isometric cubes, shaded
tetrahedra, family clusters, a curved reciprocal symbol, deterministic star
fields, projected shadows, suspended tensegrity struts, and radial vector
gardens. The stability page borrows from the Synergetics intuition that
triangulated structure braces square space: a tetrahedron is drawn through four
alternating cube corners so the cube becomes steadier without ceasing to be a
cube [@fuller1975synergetics]. Later pages extend that grammar through
projection, push-pull balance, and directional growth. This gives forks a
readable baseline. Replacing the story does not require editing Python;
replacing the visual grammar does.

# Reproducibility

The project avoids external image services and live APIs. Page images are
procedurally generated from checked-in content, and the final PDF is assembled
from those generated images. Tests check that the story loads, the two central
characters have opposite family shapes, a page renders at the configured
dimensions, the PDF page count matches the content file, and at least one page
script can run against a temporary project root.

The generated manifest records the cast, page list, and render paths. That
manifest is the compact evidence surface for the primary artifact.

# References

The bundled story is illustrative fiction. The Synergetics reference grounds
the tetrahedron-inside-cube design motif used in the stability page and the
later tensegrity/vector motifs.
